## 🧙‍♂️ How to Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Like a Pro) in VSCode Terminal

You know what they say: a project without a virtual environment is like coffee without caffeine – it just won’t work right. ☕💻

Navigate to your project directory (don’t get lost now, we believe in you) and run these commands if you’re using Windows 🏰:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

For non-Windows folks: May the force be with you. 💫

## 🛠️ Configuration

### 📜 Basic Setup for API Key and Model

Alright, secret agent. It’s time to create your `.env` file like a true professional. 👨‍💻👩‍💻
In your project directory, add a `.env` file with the following *top-secret* content:

```plaintext
API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash-latest
```

> **Warning**: Replace `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with your actual API key, unless you prefer living life on the edge without functional AI. 😱

Oh, and don’t forget to replace `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` with your favorite model. Customize it like it’s your Starbucks order. ☕🌟
